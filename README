# Configurability

Configurability is a mixin that allows you to add configurability to one 
or more classes, assign them each a section of the configuration, and 
then when the configuration is loaded, the class is given the section 
it requested.

## Usage

To add configurability to a class, just require the library and extend
it:

    class MyDatabaseClass
        extend Configurability
    end

Later, when you've loaded the configuration, can can call

    Configurability.configure_objects( config )

and the @config@ will be spliced up and sent to all the objects that have
been extended with it. @Configurability@ expects the configuration to be 
broken up into a number of sections, each of which is accessible via either
a method with the section name or the index operator (@#[]@) that takes the 
section name as a @Symbol@ or a @String@:

    config.section_name
    config[:section_name]
    config['section_name']
