= configurability

Configurability is mixin that allows you to add configurability to one or more classes, assign them each a section of the configuration, and then when the configuration is loaded, the class is given the section it requested. 

You can check out the current development source with Mercurial like so:

    hg clone http://repo.deveiate.org/configurability

You can submit bug reports, suggestions, and read more about future plans at the
